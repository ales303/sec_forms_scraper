[9/11/2020 11:19:22 AM] Christopher Alesevich: Just one last question so that I confirm I understand this correctly:

1. The first script runs every 20 mins and appends to the output url file each time it runs.
2. The second script will move the url file to an archive folder after each time it runs.

Does the second script filter for duplicate URLs in the url list when it runs? Also, does the second script filter for URLs with the current date only?


[9/11/2020 11:21:57 AM] John Dizon: 1. it runs once, you need to setup the scheduling in crontab to auto run the script every 20 minutes. each run will append to the existing file.

2. yes, after running it will move the file to archive. yes, it will filter for duplicates. and yes, it will only process urls with current date only.


Important - the headers are being hard-coded. To use the module fake-user-agent:

[9/12/2020 11:33:10 AM] John Dizon: correct
